CameraView of the note to be be captured


**PhotoReview View**
![PhotoReview View](screen%20shots/photo%20review%20view.jpeg)

PhotoReviewView gives you these options for reviewing the captured image:
- crop it, 
- proceed to transcribe it, 
- save it in your in-App photo Gallery or 
- return to camera to re-take it.


***Transcription View***

![Transcription View](screen%20shots/transcription%20review.jpeg)

The transcription is presented with options to 
- re-transcribe if youâ€™re not satisfied with the quality, 
- get a speech service so you can quickly listen without having to read everything, and 
- you can save it to your in-App saved transcriptions. 
- you can also return to the PhotoReview page to edit the image for better transcription. 


## Saving Options

## Saved Transcriptions

![Saved Transcriptions](screen%20shots/saved%20transcriptions.jpeg)

With your transcriptions saved in the app, you can return anytime to 
- edit it, 
- get speech service, 
- share it with friends and family,
- attach other related documents including images, and documents( pdfs, .txt, .doc, .docx, .xlx files etc). 
You can have all your notes right here in the same space!



## Further Improvements
- Fix the double 'back' buttons in ContentView. 
    - Application designed to keep floating 'back' button instead of the navigation 'back' button
- Inlcude speech to text transcription for an even more seamless note-taking and record keeping
- Organize transition betweeen views more efficiently and smoothly
- Include options for user to control styles and themes
- Improve cropping, zooming  and focus features
- Add selfie camera

- VERY IMPORTANTLY: 
    - Use a higher accuracy transcriber than Vision. 
    Currently vision gets a couple of characters wrong even with the most legible handwriting and for some images with digital text. 
    Vision also gives accuracy by lines and they mostly come as confidence values of 1.0
    - Highlight transcriptions of confidencee lower than 0.5 so user attention is drawn to those for immediate edition/correction
    - Incorporate a feature that learns user's handwritting as the saved gallery of handwritting images grows. This will help with even higher accuracy of transcription tailored to the user's handwriting.
